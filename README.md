# Unitaty tests FizzBuzz

## Challenge description
### Write a code where you will receive a number n, and you must print all the numbers, starting from 1 to n, with the following condition:
```
1. If a number is divisible by 3, instead of printing the number, you must print Fizz.

2. If a number is divisible by 5, instead of printing the number, you must print Buzz.

3. If a number is divisible by 3 and 5 at the same time, you must print FizzBuzz.

4. If none of the above cases are met, you should simply print the number.
```
### And do unit tests for each of these conditions
